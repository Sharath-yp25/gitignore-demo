in this repo we have tried how this .gitignore works
and we got to know that
1. Create .gitingore file
2. Add that .gitignore file to staging area
3. Add all the file extension in that .gitignore file
4. When you create any file with the extension which is present in .gitignore and if you try to add those files will be ignored
5. Verify whether files are ignored by giving the command git status
